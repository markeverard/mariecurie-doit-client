mariecurie-doit-client
======================

A c# implementation of the Do-It platform REST API. This API powers the main (https://do-it.org/)[Do-It website] and the REST client allows you to bring the Do-It functionality into your own c# platform. 

This effort was produced by the in-house digital team at (https://www.mariecurie.org.uk)[Marie Curie] as part of their back-office integration with Do-It. Talk to us for further details. 

The package depends on RestSharp and currently is implemented for opportunity based request against v1 of the Do-It API.
